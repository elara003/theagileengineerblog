        <h2>The Two Extremes</h2>
        <p>
          In nearly every engineering organization, there's an ongoing tension around what a software architect
          should actually do. On one end of the spectrum sits the "ivory tower" architect—someone who designs
          systems from above, producing diagrams and documents but rarely touching production code. On the other
          end is the "hands-on" architect—deeply embedded in the codebase, writing code alongside the team,
          sometimes to the point where strategic thinking takes a back seat.
        </p>

        <p>
          Neither extreme serves teams well. The best architects I've worked with navigate somewhere in between,
          adjusting their approach based on the team's needs, the project phase, and organizational context.
        </p>

        <h3>The Ivory Tower Architect</h3>
        <p>
          We've all seen this archetype: the architect who spends weeks crafting elaborate system diagrams,
          writes lengthy architecture decision records, and presents grand visions in steering committee meetings.
          They speak in abstractions and patterns, referencing industry frameworks and best practices.
        </p>

        <p>
          The problems with this approach are predictable:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Disconnection from reality:</strong> Designs that look elegant on a whiteboard often crumble when they meet real constraints—legacy systems, team capabilities, operational requirements</li>
          <li><strong>Loss of credibility:</strong> Teams stop trusting architectural guidance when it comes from someone who hasn't written production code in years</li>
          <li><strong>Slow feedback loops:</strong> Without hands-on implementation, architects don't learn what actually works until it's too late to course-correct</li>
          <li><strong>Over-engineering:</strong> Distance from implementation encourages adding abstraction layers that solve theoretical problems rather than real ones</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>The Fully Hands-On Architect</h3>
        <p>
          The reaction to ivory tower architecture often swings to the opposite extreme: architects who spend
          all their time coding, reviewing PRs, and fixing bugs alongside the team. They're in every standup,
          picking up tickets, and deeply familiar with every corner of the codebase.
        </p>

        <p>
          This approach has its own failure modes:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Missing the forest for the trees:</strong> When you're deep in implementation details, it's hard to step back and see systemic issues or opportunities</li>
          <li><strong>Becoming a bottleneck:</strong> If the architect is the best coder on the team, they often become a dependency for critical decisions and implementations</li>
          <li><strong>Neglecting cross-team concerns:</strong> System-wide issues like observability, security patterns, and integration standards get less attention</li>
          <li><strong>Reactive rather than proactive:</strong> All energy goes into current sprint work, leaving no capacity for anticipating future needs</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Finding the Balance</h3>
        <p>
          The most effective architects I've observed operate on a sliding scale, adjusting their involvement
          based on context. Here's what that looks like in practice:
        </p>

        <h4>Stay Close Enough to Code</h4>
        <p>
          You don't need to be the most prolific committer, but you should be writing code regularly. This might mean:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Implementing proof-of-concept work for new architectural patterns</li>
          <li>Pairing with team members on complex technical challenges</li>
          <li>Building internal tools or frameworks that embody architectural principles</li>
          <li>Taking on a small feature end-to-end each quarter to stay grounded</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Create Space for Strategic Thinking</h4>
        <p>
          Block time specifically for stepping back from implementation. Use this time to:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Review system metrics and identify emerging patterns or problems</li>
          <li>Talk to teams about their pain points and friction</li>
          <li>Research how other organizations solve similar challenges</li>
          <li>Document decisions and their rationale for future team members</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Teach Rather Than Dictate</h4>
        <p>
          The best architectural influence happens through enablement, not mandates. Instead of prescribing
          solutions, help teams understand the principles and trade-offs so they can make good decisions
          independently. Your goal is to multiply your impact through others.
        </p>

        <h3>Signals You've Gone Too Far in Either Direction</h3>

        <h4>Signs of Ivory Tower Drift</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>You can't remember the last time you ran the test suite locally</li>
          <li>Your architecture diagrams reference components that don't exist yet</li>
          <li>Teams implement your designs differently than you expected—and you're surprised</li>
          <li>Developers roll their eyes when you join technical discussions</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Signs of Getting Lost in the Weeds</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>You can't articulate the system's three biggest architectural risks</li>
          <li>Cross-cutting concerns keep getting deferred because everyone's focused on features</li>
          <li>You're the go-to person for code reviews but haven't updated the architecture docs in months</li>
          <li>Other teams are making integration decisions without your input</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Adjusting to Context</h3>
        <p>
          The right balance shifts depending on circumstances:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Early-stage projects:</strong> Lean more hands-on. Architecture emerges from working code, and early decisions have outsized impact.</li>
          <li><strong>Mature systems:</strong> Shift toward strategic work. The foundations are set; focus on evolution, optimization, and cross-system concerns.</li>
          <li><strong>Crisis mode:</strong> Get hands-on. When systems are breaking, you need to be in the trenches understanding what's actually happening.</li>
          <li><strong>Scaling teams:</strong> Focus on teaching and documentation. Your job is to help others make good decisions without you.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
        <p>
          The ivory tower vs. hands-on debate is a false dichotomy. Effective architecture requires both
          strategic vision and practical grounding. The skill is knowing when to zoom in and when to zoom out—and
          being honest with yourself about where you're spending your time.
        </p>

        <p>
          If you find yourself gravitating toward one extreme, consciously schedule activities that pull you
          toward the other. Architecture is ultimately about making systems better, and you can't do that
          from either a penthouse suite or a basement server room alone.

        <h2>Discussion</h2>
        <p>
          Where do you fall on this spectrum? How do you balance strategic thinking with staying technically
          grounded? I'd be interested to hear how different organizations approach this tension.
