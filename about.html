        <h1>About Eddy Lara</h1>
        <p>Software engineer, architect, and leader passionate about building systems that work</p>
      </div>

      <div class="content-section">
        <h2>Who I Am</h2>
        <p>
          I'm a software engineer and architect with over a decade of experience building and scaling 
          distributed systems. I've worked across different industries—from financial services to e-commerce 
          to healthcare—and I've learned that the fundamentals of good software engineering remain constant 
          even as technologies change.
        </p>

        <p>
          My focus is on the intersection of technology and team dynamics. The best technical solutions mean 
          nothing if your team can't implement and maintain them. Similarly, the most efficient team processes 
          fall apart if the underlying technology doesn't support them.
        </p>

        <h3>What Drives Me</h3>
        <p>
          I'm passionate about turning complex business problems into simple, maintainable solutions. Too often, 
          I see teams adding complexity when what they really need is clarity. My goal is always to find the 
          simplest thing that could possibly work, and then evolve from there.
        </p>

        <p>
          I believe in:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Pragmatic architecture</strong> - patterns that solve real problems, not just look good on whiteboards</li>
          <li><strong>Sustainable development</strong> - code and practices that teams can maintain over years, not just ship</li>
          <li><strong>Continuous learning</strong> - staying curious about new technologies while remaining grounded in fundamentals</li>
          <li><strong>Knowledge sharing</strong> - making complex concepts accessible to teams at all levels</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>My Approach</h3>
        <p>
          When I encounter a new system or problem, I start with questions, not solutions:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>What are we actually trying to achieve?</li>
          <li>What are the real constraints we're working within?</li>
          <li>How will this system evolve over time?</li>
          <li>Who will maintain this, and what's their context?</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          Only after understanding the problem space do I start thinking about technical solutions. And even then, 
          I prefer boring, well-understood technologies over shiny new ones—unless there's a compelling reason 
          to do otherwise.

        <h2>Beyond Code</h2>
        <p>
          When I'm not writing code or designing systems, I enjoy:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Reading</strong> - Both technical books and science fiction (often finding surprising connections between them)</li>
          <li><strong>Speaking</strong> - Presenting at conferences and meetups about practical software architecture</li>
          <li><strong>Mentoring</strong> - Working with junior engineers to help them grow their technical and problem-solving skills</li>
          <li><strong>Writing</strong> - Documenting lessons learned and sharing practical insights through this blog</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Get in Touch</h3>
        <p>
          I'm always interested in connecting with other engineers who are passionate about building great software. 
          Whether you want to discuss architecture patterns, share war stories from production systems, or collaborate 
          on interesting projects, feel free to reach out.
